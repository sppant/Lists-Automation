The Lists Automation is a web application that allows customers and their spots (videos) to be inserted in the system. Based on certain criteria that the user defines, the system creates a schedule (text file + OnTheAir Video lists) for a specific period of time (from 1 day to forever) which can be used to display video spots on the TV
